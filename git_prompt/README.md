#### bash/zsh git prompt support
- Below is a copy from `git-prompt.sh` file for better rendering on GitHub.
- The `git-prompt.sh` allows you to see repository status in your prompt.
- To enable, do the following:
```
    1) Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-prompt.sh).
    2) Add the following line to your .bashrc/.zshrc:
        source ~/.git-prompt.sh
    3a) Change your PS1 to call __git_ps1 as
        command-substitution:
        Bash: PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
        ZSH:  setopt PROMPT_SUBST ; PS1='[%n@%m %c$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
        the optional argument will be used as format string.
    3b) Alternatively, for a slightly faster prompt, __git_ps1 can
        be used for PROMPT_COMMAND in Bash or for precmd() in Zsh
        with two parameters, <pre> and <post>, which are strings
        you would put in $PS1 before and after the status string
        generated by the git-prompt machinery.  e.g.
        Bash: PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "\u@\h:\w" "\\\$ "'
          will show username, at-sign, host, colon, cwd, then
          various status string, followed by dollar and SP, as
          your prompt.
        ZSH:  precmd () { __git_ps1 "%n" ":%~$ " "|%s" }
          will show username, pipe, then various status string,
          followed by colon, cwd, dollar and SP, as your prompt.
        Optionally, you can supply a third argument with a printf
        format string to finetune the output of the branch status
```
- The most important steps are (1) and (2).
- The repository status will be displayed only if you are currently in a
git repository. The `%s` token is the placeholder for the shown status.
The prompt status always includes the current branch name.
